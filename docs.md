### Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | FastAPI 0.136 |
| Language | Python 3.12 |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async) |
| Database | PostgreSQL via asyncpg |
| Auth | JWT — argon2 password hash, python-jose tokens |
| Migrations | Alembic |
| Email | Resend |
| Containerization | Docker + Docker Compose |

---

## 2. Authentication

### Token Strategy

The API uses two JWTs per session:

| Token | Lifetime | Sent via | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Access token** | `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` (env) | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | Authenticate requests |
| **Refresh token** | `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` (env) | Request body for `/auth/refresh` | Keep mobile/desktop clients signed in without putting the long-lived token on every API call |

Both tokens carry a `type` claim (`"access"` or `"refresh"`). Protected routes require access tokens. The `/auth/refresh` endpoint requires a refresh token and rejects access tokens.

### Token Payload

```json
{
  "sub": "<user_uuid>",
  "exp": 1234567890,
  "type": "access"
}
```

### Protected Routes

All routes except the following require `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`:

- `POST /auth/register`
- `POST /auth/login`
- `POST /auth/refresh`
- `GET  /auth/forgot-password`
- `POST /auth/forgot-password`
- `GET  /auth/reset-password`
- `PUT  /auth/reset-password`
- `GET  /health`
- `GET  /`

---

## 3. Endpoints Reference

### Standard Response Envelope

Every successful response is wrapped in:

```json
{
  "message": "Human-readable status string",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

---

### 3.1 Auth

#### `POST /auth/register`

Creates a new local account and returns tokens immediately.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "name": "Jagdeep Singh",
  "email": "jagdeep@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

**Response `201`:**
```json
{
  "message": "User created successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "user_code": "A1B2C3",
    "name": "Jagdeep Singh",
    "email": "jagdeep@example.com",
    "auth_provider": "LOCAL",
    "profile_picture": null,
    "created_at": "2026-05-11T22:47:02Z"
  },
  "tokens": {
    "access_token": "eyJ...",
    "refresh_token": "eyJ...",
    "token_type": "bearer"
  }
}
```

**Errors:**
- `400` — Email already registered

**Notes:**
- A random 6-character hex `user_code` (e.g. `"A1B2C3"`) is generated and guaranteed unique at registration time.
- Password is hashed with Argon2 before storage.

---

#### `POST /auth/login`

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "email": "jagdeep@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

**Response `200`:** Same shape as `/register`.

**Errors:**
- `401` — Invalid email or password

---

#### `GET /auth/me` 🔒

Returns the currently authenticated user.

**Response `200`:**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "user_code": "A1B2C3",
  "name": "Jagdeep Singh",
  "email": "jagdeep@example.com",
  "auth_provider": "LOCAL",
  "profile_picture": null,
  "created_at": "2026-05-11T22:47:02Z"
}
```

---

#### `POST /auth/refresh`

Exchanges a valid refresh token for a new access + refresh token pair.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "refresh_token": "eyJ..."
}
```

**Response `200`:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

**Errors:**
- `401` — Invalid or expired refresh token

---

#### `POST /auth/logout` 🔒

**Response `200`:**
```json
{ "message": "Logged out successfully" }
```

> ⚠️ **Hole:** This endpoint does nothing server-side. The refresh token is not invalidated. Any client holding the old refresh token can still obtain new access tokens until the refresh token naturally expires.

---

#### `GET /auth/forgot-password`

Renders the forgot-password HTML page (not a JSON API endpoint).

---

#### `POST /auth/forgot-password`

Sends a password-reset email.

**Request body:**
```json
{ "email": "jagdeep@example.com" }
```

**Response `200`:**
```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Reset email sent" }
```

**Errors:**
- `404` — No account found with that email
- `400` — Account uses Google Sign-In (cannot reset local password)
- `500` — Resend API failed

**Flow:**
1. Look up user by email.
2. Generate a 32-byte URL-safe random token, SHA-256 hash it.
3. Store the hash + expiry in `password-reset-table`.
4. Send email with `{BACKEND_URL}/auth/reset-password?token={raw_token}`.

> ⚠️ **Hole:** Token expires in **10 minutes** (hardcoded `timedelta(minutes=10)` in `auth_service.py`), but the email template says "10 minutes" and the reset HTML page says "30 minutes". Inconsistency in user-facing messaging.

> ⚠️ **Hole:** No rate limiting. Anyone can hammer this endpoint to trigger repeated email sends to any valid address.

---

#### `GET /auth/reset-password?token=<raw_token>`

Renders the password-reset HTML page.

---

#### `PUT /auth/reset-password`

Commits the new password.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "token": "<raw_token_from_email>",
  "password": "newpassword123"
}
```

**Response `200`:**
```json
{ "message": "Password reset successfully" }
```

**Errors:**
- `400` — Token invalid, expired, or already used

**Flow:**
1. SHA-256 hash the incoming token.
2. Look up a matching, unexpired, unused record in `password-reset-table`.
3. Hash and store the new password on the user record.
4. Mark the token as `used = true`.

> ⚠️ **Hole:** `AuthRepository.delete_token` (cleans up used tokens) is defined but **never called**. Used tokens accumulate forever in `password-reset-table`.

---

### 3.2 Users

#### `GET /users/me` 🔒

Returns the current user's profile. Same shape as `GET /auth/me`.

---

#### `PUT /users/me` 🔒

Updates `name` and/or `profile_picture`.

**Request body (all fields optional):**
```json
{
  "name": "New Name",
  "profile_picture": "https://cdn.example.com/avatar.png"
}
```

**Response `200`:** Updated user object.

---

#### `DELETE /users/me` 🔒

Soft-deletes the account by setting `is_active = false`.

**Response `200`:**
```json
{ "message": "Account deactivated successfully" }
```

> ⚠️ **Hole:** This is a soft delete only. The user record and all associated data remain in the database. There is no hard-delete path and no way to reactivate from the API.

---

### 3.3 Groups

#### `POST /groups/` 🔒

Creates a group and automatically adds the creator as a member.

**Request body:**
```json
{ "name": "Goa Trip" }
```

**Response `201`:**
```json
{
  "message": "Group created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Goa Trip",
    "created_by": "uuid",
    "created_at": "2026-05-11T22:47:02Z"
  }
}
```

---

#### `GET /groups/` 🔒

Lists all groups the current user belongs to.

**Response `200`:** Array of group objects.

> ⚠️ **Hole:** Returns `404` if the user has no groups instead of an empty array `[]`. This is a semantic bug — "no results" is not an error.

---

#### `GET /groups/{group_id}` 🔒

Returns a single group. Requires the caller to be a member.

**Errors:**
- `404` — Group not found
- `403` — Not a member

---

#### `PUT /groups/{group_id}` 🔒

Updates the group name. Only the group **creator** may do this.

**Request body:**
```json
{ "name": "Updated Name" }
```

**Errors:**
- `403` — Not the group creator

---

#### `DELETE /groups/{group_id}` 🔒

Deletes the group. Only the group **creator** may do this.

> ⚠️ **Hole:** No cascading deletes are configured at the application level. When a group is deleted, associated `group_members`, `group_expenses`, `expense_splits`, and `settlements` records are left orphaned unless PostgreSQL foreign key cascades are set (they are not in the migration scripts).

---

### 3.4 Group Members

#### `GET /groups/{group_id}/members` 🔒

Lists all members of a group. Requires the caller to be a member.

**Response `200`:**
```json
{
  "message": "List of members fetched successfully",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "group_id": "uuid",
      "user_id": "uuid",
      "joined_at": "2026-05-11T22:47:02Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

> ⚠️ **Hole:** The `role` field (`ADMIN` / `MEMBER`) is stored in the database but is **not returned** in `GroupMemberResponse`. Roles exist at the model level but are never used to gate any action anywhere in the codebase.

---

#### `POST /groups/{group_id}/members` 🔒

Adds a user to the group by their `user_code`.

**Request body:**
```json
{ "user_code": "A1B2C3" }
```

**Response `200`:** New member object.

**Errors:**
- `403` — Caller is not a member of the group
- `400` — User already in the group
- `404` — User with that code not found (will surface as an AttributeError if `get_user_by_user_code` returns `None` — see bugs section)

> ⚠️ **Hole:** Any group member can add other users. There is no ADMIN-only gate despite the `Role` enum existing.

---

#### `DELETE /groups/{group_id}/members/{user_id}` 🔒

Removes a member from the group.

**Errors:**
- `403` — Caller is not a member
- `404` — Target user is not a member

> ⚠️ **Hole:** `has_pending_balance` in `ExpenseRepository` is defined but **never called** here. A member with outstanding debts or credits can be removed freely, leaving dangling balance data with no linked group member.

> ⚠️ **Hole:** The group creator can be removed by any other member (as long as the remover is themselves a member). There is no protection for the creator/admin role.

---

### 3.5 Group Expenses

#### `POST /groups/{group_id}/expenses` 🔒

Creates an expense and persists splits to `expense_splits`.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "title": "Hotel Booking",
  "amount": "5000.00",
  "split_type": "equal",
  "equal_member_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2"]
}
```

`split_type` can be `"equal"`, `"exact"`, or `"percentage"`.

**For `equal` split:**
- `equal_member_ids` — optional list of member UUIDs to split among (defaults to all group members if omitted)

**For `exact` split:**
- `splits_input` — required map of `{ user_id: amount }`, amounts must sum exactly to `amount`

**For `percentage` split:**
- `splits_input` — required map of `{ user_id: percentage }`, percentages must sum to `100`

**Response `201`:**
```json
{
  "message": "Expense created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "group_id": "uuid",
    "paid_by": "uuid",
    "title": "Hotel Booking",
    "amount": "5000.00",
    "split_type": "equal",
    "created_at": "2026-05-11T22:47:02Z"
  }
}
```

**Errors:**
- `403` — Not a group member
- `404` — Group not found
- `400` — Split validation failure (non-members in split, totals don't match, etc.)

---

#### `GET /groups/{group_id}/expenses` 🔒

Lists all expenses for the group.

**Response `200`:** Array of expense objects.

---

#### `GET /groups/{group_id}/expenses/{expense_id}` 🔒

> ⚠️ **Critical Bug:** This route is broken at the service layer. `expense_service.get_expense` builds its response as a Python **set literal** (`{model, list}`), which is invalid (a Pydantic model is not hashable). This will raise a `TypeError` at runtime on every call.

---

#### `PUT /groups/{group_id}/expenses/{expense_id}` 🔒

Updates an expense's `title` and/or `amount`. Only the original payer may update.

**Request body (all optional):**
```json
{
  "title": "Updated Title",
  "amount": "6000.00"
}
```

> ⚠️ **Hole:** Updating `amount` does **not** recalculate or update the associated `expense_splits`. After an amount update, the splits will reflect the old amount, causing balance calculations to be wrong.

---

#### `DELETE /groups/{group_id}/expenses/{expense_id}` 🔒

Deletes the expense. Only the payer **or** the group creator may delete.

> ⚠️ **Hole:** No cascade is configured on `GroupExpense.splits`. Deleting an expense leaves all its `ExpenseSplit` rows as orphaned records in the database.

> ⚠️ **Hole:** Deleting a group expense does not delete or update the corresponding `PersonalExpense` record that may have been synced from it (the sync engine is referenced in the README but not implemented in any route handler).

---

### 3.6 Balances

> ⚠️ **Critical Hole:** `routes/balances.py` exists and is fully implemented, but it is **never registered** in `main.py`. Both balance endpoints are completely unreachable.

To fix: add to `main.py`:
```python
from routes.balances import router as balances_router
app.include_router(balances_router)
```

#### `GET /groups/{group_id}/balances` 🔒 *(currently unreachable)*

Returns the net balance for every member of the group (only non-zero balances are returned).

A **positive** value means that member is owed money overall. A **negative** value means they owe money overall.

**Response `200`:**
```json
{
  "message": "Balances fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "uuid-alice": "350.00",
    "uuid-bob": "-350.00"
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Performance Hole:** `BalanceService.get_group_balances` executes **N+1 database queries** (one full balance calculation per group member). For a group of 20 members, this is 20 separate round-trips, each fetching expenses, splits, and settlements individually.

---

#### `GET /groups/{group_id}/balances/{user_id}` 🔒 *(currently unreachable)*

Returns the calling user's pairwise balance against every other member of the group.

**Response `200`:**
```json
{
  "message": "User balance fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "uuid-alice": "200.00",
    "uuid-carol": "-150.00"
  }
}
```

---

### 3.7 Settlements

> ⚠️ **Critical Hole:** `routes/settlements.py` is an **empty file** and is **not registered** in `main.py`. The Settlement model, repository, schema, and service are all fully implemented, but there is zero API surface to reach them. The settlement feature simply does not exist at the HTTP level.

What *should* be here, based on the README, the schema, and the service:

#### `POST /groups/{group_id}/settlements` 🔒 *(not implemented)*

Records that the current user paid someone else.

**Expected request body:**
```json
{
  "receiver_id": "uuid",
  "amount": "350.00"
}
```

#### `GET /groups/{group_id}/settlements` 🔒 *(not implemented)*

Lists all settlements for the group.

**Expected response:** `SettlementListResponse` containing `settlements[]` and `total_count`.

---

### 3.8 Debt Breakdown

#### `GET /groups/{group_id}/debt-breakdown` 🔒

Returns a multi-stage breakdown of who owes whom.

> ⚠️ **Critical Bug:** `DebtBreakdownService.get_group_debt_breakdown` calls `self.expense_repository.get_group_expense_with_splits(group_id)`, but **this method does not exist** on `ExpenseRepository`. The repository has `list_by_group` (which does not eagerly load splits) and `get_splits` (takes an expense ID, not a group ID). Every call to this endpoint will raise an `AttributeError` and return a 500.

**Expected response `200` (once fixed):**
```json
{
  "message": "User debt breakdown fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "breakdown": {
      "debtor_uuid": {
        "creditor_uuid": [
          { "expense_id": "uuid", "title": "Hotel", "amount": "1000.00" }
        ]
      }
    },
    "aggregated": {
      "debtor_uuid": { "creditor_uuid": "1000.00" }
    },
    "simplified": {
      "debtor_uuid": { "creditor_uuid": "800.00" }
    },
    "settled": {
      "debtor_uuid": { "creditor_uuid": "800.00" }
    }
  }
}
```

The four stages mean:
- **breakdown** — Per-expense debt entries (who owes whom for each specific expense)
- **aggregated** — Raw totals summed across all expenses
- **simplified** — Reverse debts cancelled against each other (if Alice owes Bob ₹500 and Bob owes Alice ₹200, simplified shows Alice owes Bob ₹300)
- **settled** — Minimum cash-flow settlement (chain simplification across multiple parties)

---

### 3.9 Personal Expenses

#### `POST /expenses/` 🔒

Creates a standalone personal expense.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "title": "Groceries",
  "amount": "450.00",
  "category": "Food",
  "date": "2026-05-11T00:00:00Z",
  "notes": "Weekly shopping"
}
```

**Response `201`:** Created expense object.

---

#### `GET /expenses/` 🔒

Lists all personal expenses for the current user, ordered by `created_at` descending.

---

#### `GET /expenses/{expense_id}` 🔒

Returns a single personal expense.

---

#### `PUT /expenses/{expense_id}` 🔒

Updates any fields on the personal expense.

---

#### `DELETE /expenses/{expense_id}` 🔒

Deletes the personal expense.

---

#### `GET /expenses/personal-data` 🔒

> ⚠️ **Critical Bug:** This route is **unreachable**. In `routes/personal_expenses.py`, it is registered at path `/personal-data` but is declared *after* `GET /{expense_id}`. FastAPI matches routes in registration order, so any request to `/expenses/personal-data` will match `/{expense_id}` first, with `expense_id = "personal-data"` — then fail with a UUID validation error or a 404.

**Fix:** Move the `personal-data` route registration *before* `/{expense_id}`.

**Expected response `200` (once fix is applied):**
```json
{
  "message": "Personal expense analytics generated successfully",
  "data": {
    "total_spent": "4500.00",
    "expense_count": 12,
    "spending_by_category": {
      "Food": "1200.00",
      "Travel": "2500.00",
      "Uncategorized": "800.00"
    }
  }
}
```

## 5. Core Engines

### Split Engine (`engines/split_engine.py`)

`calculate_splits(total_amount, all_members_id, split_type, splits_input, equal_member_ids)`

| `split_type` | Input | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| `equal` | optional `equal_member_ids` | `round(total / n, 2)` per member; defaults to all group members |
| `exact` | required `splits_input: {uuid: Decimal}` | Validates sum == total, returns as-is |
| `percentage` | required `splits_input: {uuid: Decimal}` | Validates sum == 100, computes `round(total * pct / 100, 2)` |

All modes validate that split participants are current group members.

> ⚠️ **Precision Note:** `equal` uses simple `round(total / n, 2)`. For `₹100.00 / 3`, each person gets `₹33.33` and `₹0.01` is silently lost. There is no rounding remainder redistribution.

---

### Balance Engine (`engines/balance_engine.py`)

**`compute_raw_balance(expenses_paid, user_splits, user_id)`**

For a given user, iterates:
- All expenses they paid → sum what others owe them (positive)
- All splits they appear in → subtract what they owe others (negative)

Returns `{ other_user_id: net_amount }`. Positive = owed to you. Negative = you owe them.

**`apply_settlements(balances, payments_made, payments_received)`**

Adjusts the raw balance map by applying recorded settlements. Removes zero-balance entries.

**`compute_category_totals(expenses)`**

Aggregates personal expenses by category, plus a `"__total__"` key for the grand total.

---

### Debt Breakdown Engine (`engines/debt_breakdown_engine.py`)

Four pure functions, each building on the previous:

**1. `build_debt_breakdown(expenses)`**

Input: list of expense dicts with embedded splits.
Output: `{ debtor_id: { creditor_id: [{ expense_id, title, amount }] } }`

Each split where `split_user != paid_by` creates one debt entry.

**2. `aggregate_debt(breakdown)`**

Collapses the per-expense list into a single total:
`{ debtor_id: { creditor_id: Decimal } }`

**3. `simplify_debt(aggregated_debt)`**

Cancels reverse debts. If A→B is ₹500 and B→A is ₹200, output is A→B ₹300. Equal reverse debts cancel completely.

**4. `settle_debts(aggregated_debt)`**

Minimum cash-flow algorithm using two deques (debtors sorted by amount owed, creditors sorted by amount receivable). Chains debts through intermediaries (A→B→C becomes A→C directly). Rounds to 2 decimal places.

**5. `calculate_net_balance(aggregated_debt, user_id)`**

Returns a single `Decimal` net balance for one user across the whole map.

---

### Settlement Engine (`engines/settlement_engine.py`)

**Currently an empty file with a comment `# something goes here`.**

---

## 6. Response Envelope

```python
class SuccessResponse(BaseModel, Generic[T]):
    message: str
    data: Optional[T] = None
```

All successful route handlers return this shape. `data` can be a single object, a list, a dict, or `null` (for delete operations).

```python
class ErrorResponse(BaseModel):
    detail: str
```

FastAPI's default `HTTPException` uses the `detail` field.

---

## 7. Error Responses

| HTTP Code | When Used |
|---|---|
| `400` | Validation failure, duplicate registration, bad split inputs |
| `401` | Missing, invalid, or expired token; wrong password |
| `403` | Authenticated but not authorized (not a member, not the creator/payer) |
| `404` | Resource not found |
| `422` | Pydantic validation error on request body |
| `500` | Unhandled exception (see bug list for several guaranteed 500s) |

## 8. Known Bugs & Holes in the Flow

This section documents every identified issue at the time of writing, ordered by severity.

---

### 🔴 Critical — Will cause 500 errors or completely broken features

---

#### BUG-01 · Balances router not registered in `main.py`

**File:** `main.py`
**Impact:** `GET /groups/{group_id}/balances` and `GET /groups/{group_id}/balances/{user_id}` return 404 for every request.
**Fix:**
```python
from routes.balances import router as balances_router
app.include_router(balances_router)
```

---

#### BUG-02 · `routes/settlements.py` is empty and not registered

**File:** `routes/settlements.py`, `main.py`
**Impact:** The entire settlements feature — recording payments, listing payment history — is completely inaccessible via the API. The model, repository, service, and schemas are fully written but never reachable.
**Fix:** Implement the routes file and register it in `main.py`:
```python
from routes.settlements import router as settlements_router
app.include_router(settlements_router)
```

---

#### BUG-03 · `get_group_expense_with_splits` method does not exist

**File:** `services/debt_breakdown_service.py:31`, `repository/expense_repository.py`
**Impact:** `GET /groups/{group_id}/debt-breakdown` always raises `AttributeError` and returns HTTP 500.
**Fix:** Add the missing method to `ExpenseRepository`:
```python
async def get_group_expense_with_splits(self, group_id: UUID) -> list[GroupExpense]:
    result = await self.session.execute(
        select(GroupExpense)
        .options(selectinload(GroupExpense.splits))
        .where(GroupExpense.group_id == group_id)
    )
    return list(result.scalars().all())
```

---

#### BUG-04 · `get_expense` returns a Python set literal

**File:** `services/expense_service.py:95`
**Impact:** `GET /groups/{group_id}/expenses/{expense_id}` always raises `TypeError: unhashable type: 'ExpenseResponse'` and returns HTTP 500.
**Current code:**
```python
data={
    ExpenseResponse.model_validate(expense),     # ← set syntax, not dict
    [ExpenseSplitResponse.model_validate(s) for s in splits],
}
```
**Fix:**
```python
data={
    "expense": ExpenseResponse.model_validate(expense),
    "splits": [ExpenseSplitResponse.model_validate(s) for s in splits],
}
```

---

#### BUG-05 · `has_pending_balance` logic is inverted

**File:** `repository/expense_repository.py:65`
**Impact:** The method returns `True` when the user has **no** pending balance and `False` when they **do**. Any caller relying on this (e.g., blocking member removal when debts exist) would do the exact opposite of the intended behavior.
**Current:**
```python
return result.scalar_one_or_none() is None   # True = no rows found = no balance
```
**Fix:**
```python
return result.scalar_one_or_none() is not None
```

---

#### BUG-06 · `/expenses/personal-data` route is unreachable

**File:** `routes/personal_expenses.py`
**Impact:** `GET /expenses/personal-data` matches the `/{expense_id}` route first. FastAPI tries to coerce `"personal-data"` as a UUID, fails with 422.
**Fix:** Move the `personal-data` route registration **above** the `/{expense_id}` route in the file.

---

#### BUG-07 · `SplitType` enum value mismatch between model and database

**File:** `models/group_expenses.py`, `alembic/versions/ebfc8f473775_add_enum_types.py`
**Impact:** The Python enum has lowercase values (`"equal"`, `"exact"`, `"percentage"`), but the PostgreSQL enum type created by Alembic has uppercase values (`EQUAL`, `EXACT`, `PERCENTAGE`). Writing a `SplitType.EQUAL` (Python value: `"equal"`) to the column will fail with a PostgreSQL invalid enum value error on insert.
**Fix:** Align the Python enum values with the DB enum:
```python
class SplitType(Enum):
    EQUAL = "EQUAL"
    EXACT = "EXACT"
    PERCENTAGE = "PERCENTAGE"
```
Or recreate the DB enum with lowercase values.

---

#### BUG-08 · `AuthProvider` enum value mismatch between model and database

**File:** `models/user.py`, `alembic/versions/d6ecfd59fc59_initial_schema.py`
**Impact:** Same class of bug as BUG-07. Python values are `"local"` / `"google"` but the Alembic migration creates `"LOCAL"` / `"GOOGLE"`.

---

#### BUG-09 · `Role` enum value mismatch between model and database

**File:** `models/group_members.py`, `alembic/versions/ebfc8f473775_add_enum_types.py`
**Impact:** Same class of bug as BUG-07. Python values are `"admin"` / `"member"` but the DB enum is `"ADMIN"` / `"MEMBER"`.

---

### 🟠 High — Significant functional gaps or data integrity issues

---

#### BUG-10 · Deleting an expense orphans its splits

**File:** `models/group_expenses.py`, `repository/expense_repository.py`
**Impact:** `DELETE /groups/{group_id}/expenses/{expense_id}` deletes the `GroupExpense` row but leaves all related `ExpenseSplit` rows in the database. These orphaned rows will skew future balance calculations.
**Fix:** Add cascade to the relationship:
```python
splits = relationship("ExpenseSplit", back_populates="expense", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
```

---

#### BUG-11 · `list_groups` returns 404 for users with zero groups

**File:** `services/group_service.py:37`
**Impact:** A brand new user who hasn't joined or created any group gets a 404 error from `GET /groups/`, which breaks any frontend that relies on this to show an empty state.
**Fix:**
```python
if not groups:
    return SuccessResponse(message="No groups found", data=[])
```

---

#### BUG-12 · Updating expense amount does not recalculate splits

**File:** `services/expense_service.py`, `repository/expense_repository.py`
**Impact:** After `PUT /groups/{group_id}/expenses/{expense_id}` changes the amount, the `expense_splits` table still holds amounts computed from the original total. Balance calculations will be based on stale split data.
**Fix:** Invalidate and recompute splits on amount change, or disallow amount updates and require delete + recreate.

---

#### BUG-13 · Member removal does not check for pending balances

**File:** `services/group_service.py:remove_member`
**Impact:** A user with outstanding debts or credits can be removed from a group. Their balance data becomes unreachable via the members list, but the underlying `expense_splits` and `settlements` rows remain, creating ghost debts.
**Fix:** Call `ExpenseRepository.has_pending_balance` (after fixing BUG-05) before removing:
```python
expense_repo = ExpenseRepository(db)
if await expense_repo.has_pending_balance(group_id, user_id):
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="User has pending balance")
```

---

#### BUG-14 · Used reset tokens are never cleaned up

**File:** `services/auth_service.py`, `repository/user_repository.py`
**Impact:** `AuthRepository.delete_token` is implemented (correctly deletes all `used=True` tokens for a user) but is never called anywhere. The `password-reset-table` grows without bound.
**Fix:** Call `await repo_auth.delete_token(user.id)` at the end of `reset_password`.

---

#### BUG-15 · `logout` does not invalidate the refresh token

**File:** `routes/auth.py`, `services/auth_service.py`
**Impact:** After logout, a client retaining the refresh token can silently re-acquire new access tokens indefinitely. There is no server-side session revocation.
**Fix:** Store refresh tokens in the database (or Redis) and mark them as revoked on logout. The `POST /auth/refresh` endpoint should verify the token has not been revoked.

---

### 🟡 Medium — Missing features or notable gaps

---

#### BUG-16 · Google OAuth schema exists but no route

**File:** `schemas/user.py:GoogleAuthRequest`
**Impact:** `GoogleAuthRequest` is defined with a `token: str` field, and `AuthProvider.GOOGLE` is a valid enum value, but there is no `POST /auth/google` route. Google sign-in cannot be used.

---

#### BUG-17 · `BalanceService.aggregate_totals` is never exposed

**File:** `services/balance_service.py:aggregate_totals`
**Impact:** Category-level spending totals for the current user can be computed but there is no endpoint to retrieve them.

---

#### BUG-18 · N+1 queries in `get_group_balances`

**File:** `services/balance_service.py:get_group_balances`
**Impact:** For a group of N members, this method makes N separate calls to `get_user_balance_in_group`, each of which issues multiple DB queries. A group with 20 members could trigger 100+ round-trips.
**Fix:** Aggregate all expenses, splits, and settlements for the group in a single set of queries, then compute all balances in-memory.

---

#### BUG-19 · Sync engine described in README but not implemented

**File:** README, `services/auth_service.py` (comment at bottom)
**Impact:** Group expenses are supposed to be mirrored into `personal_expenses` for each involved user (via a `SyncService`). This service is listed in the README and the `PersonalExpense` model has `group_id` and `group_expense_id` foreign keys to support it, but the sync service file does not exist and no route triggers it.

---

#### BUG-20 · `add_member` does not handle user-not-found gracefully

**File:** `services/group_service.py:add_member`

**Impact:** If `user_repo.get_user_by_user_code(user_code)` returns `None`, the next line `user_id = user.id` raises `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'id'`, returning an unhandled 500 instead of a clean 404.
**Fix:**
```python
user = await user_repo.get_user_by_user_code(user_code)
if not user:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
```

---

#### BUG-21 · No rate limiting on password reset

**File:** `routes/auth.py`, `services/auth_service.py`
**Impact:** The `POST /auth/forgot-password` endpoint has no throttle. An attacker can flood a target's inbox or exhaust Resend API quota.
**Fix:** Add rate limiting middleware (e.g., `slowapi`) keyed on IP and/or email.

---

#### BUG-22 · Password reset expiry inconsistency

**File:** `services/auth_service.py:168`, `templates/password-reset.html`
**Impact:** The token expires in 10 minutes (code), but the reset page tells users the link is valid for 30 minutes. Users will be confused when their link expires.
**Fix:** Align both to the same value and extract it to the config/env.

---

#### BUG-23 · `equal` split does not distribute rounding remainder

**File:** `engines/split_engine.py`
**Impact:** `₹100.00 / 3` assigns `₹33.33` to each of 3 members, silently discarding `₹0.01`. Over many expenses, cumulative rounding error can accumulate in balances.
**Fix:** Assign the remainder to the first (or last) member in the list:
```python
shares = [round(total_amount / len(target_ids), 2)] * len(target_ids)
remainder = total_amount - sum(shares)
shares[0] += remainder
return dict(zip(target_ids, shares))
```

---

### 🔵 Low — Code quality & minor issues

---

#### BUG-24 · `settlement_engine.py` is a stub

**File:** `engines/settlement_engine.py`
**Content:** `# something goes here`
The debt breakdown engine contains `settle_debts` itself, but a dedicated settlement engine for recording and reversing settlements was intended here.

---

#### BUG-25 · `SettlementUpdate` only allows amount changes

**File:** `schemas/settlement.py`
The schema comment says "to update receiver we delete the settlement and create new one", but there is no delete-settlement or update-settlement route implemented.

---

#### BUG-26 · `Group` deletion has no cascade at DB level

**File:** `alembic/versions/d6ecfd59fc59_initial_schema.py`
Foreign keys are created without `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Deleting a group at the DB level will fail due to FK constraints unless the application manually deletes dependents first (which it does not).

---

#### BUG-27 · `Role` field not returned in member responses

**File:** `schemas/groups.py:GroupMemberResponse`
The `role` field is stored but excluded from the response schema, making the role system invisible to API consumers.

---

#### BUG-28 · No `conftest.py` for integration tests

**File:** `tests/`
`test_full_flow.py` and `test_db.py` use `@pytest.mark.anyio` but there is no visible `conftest.py` configuring `anyio_mode = "auto"`. Tests may fail to run without it.
**Fix:** Create `tests/conftest.py`:
```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def anyio_backend():
    return "asyncio"
```

---

#### BUG-29 · `DELETE /users/me` doesn't clean up group memberships

**File:** `routes/users.py`
Deactivating an account only sets `is_active = false`. The user remains in all their groups, and their `group_memberships`, `expense_splits`, and `settlements` records are untouched.

---
